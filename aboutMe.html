                My Name is Kyle, I study Computer Science at AUT.
                <p></p><p></p>
                I enjoy learning many different subjects, and I also enjoy teaching people
                about subjects I've learnt that they may not know about. I am currently learning
                Game Development, Programming Languages and Theory of Computation at AUT.
                For myself, I am learning how to program small projects to make my life
                more convient, such as a Discord Bot.
                <p></p>
                I've been told by my peers that I'm friendly and easy to get along with.
                I also seem to get a laugh out of most of them at some point with my
                witty comebacks.
