        description: `<p>The start of this project was delayed, I knew what I would need to do however I 
        was preoccupied with creating other projects. After creating the changes from the previous version 
        I showed my teammate and they approved of the changes finding them to make the code base a lot 
        easier to work with. It also meant that further iterations would be less complicated and finding 
        bugs would become a lot simplier.</p>
        
        <h2>Further details:</h2>
        <p>To start the first part I changed was removing controls from the code base and creating a folder 
        where controls could be placed, splitting it into 2 classes of movement and one for input. This 
        would mean that if we added more inputs they would only go into one class and then changing how 
        movement worked for later could be done with minimal issues.</p>
            
        <p>The next step I took was removing obstacle spawning and movement from the main codebase into 
        it's own folder and into 2 classes. This did however result in a bug where after reset obstacles 
        would immeditly spawn instead of taking the time they took before to spawn. This is a bug I'd have 
        to solve later, however at the time I placed it on a lower priority than getting the code fully 
        seperated.</p>
        
        <p>The final step was to remove game manager from the system into their own folder and into 
        3 classes, these classes would be score, time and gameOver. The score was done first and I 
        figured out quickly that I'd need to remove time for this to be effective as many objects in score 
        called time. Once I got time sorted as well, both functioned and then I got to work with the game 
        restart and game over. With all of these working, I had made the code base a lot easier to function 
        and also decreased the reading complexity of the code</p>
        
        <p>I then returned to the bug, which required me to resort how the spawning was working, where I 
        found the bug was because I failed to reinitalize the obstacle array correctly and remove all 
        the obstacles that were there before, thus placing you where you were before just having every 
        obstacle move places. This also then fixed the second issue that sometimes occured where 
        obstacles would stop moving after all original obstacles were destroyed. Once everything 
        was sorted the game was in the same state as before I started the project, so players would 
        not experince the difference but for coding in future these changes would make the game feel a 
        lot more clean and readable.</p>`,

        subtitle: "Version 0.2 ~ option A",
        description: `<p>This version started a bit later than planned, as I was occupied with other 
        projects. But once I returned to it, I focused on restructuring the codebase to make future 
        development easier. After showing the changes to my teammate, they found the new structure 
        much easier to work with—which made debugging and iterating smoother.</p>
        
        Key Changes:
        <ul><li><strong>Input Refactor:</strong>Moved control logic into a separate folder with two 
        movement classes and one input class. This modular setup means future inputs can be 
        added in one place with minimal disruption.</li> <li><strong>Obstacle Logic:</strong> 
        Extracted obstacle spawning and movement into their own folder and split into two classes. 
        Initially caused a bug where obstacles spawned too quickly after reset—this was noted for later.
        </li> <li><strong>Game Manager Breakdown:</strong> Separated game management into three classes: 
        <code>Score</code>, <code>Time</code>, and <code>GameOver</code>. Time had to be decoupled before 
        score would function properly, due to dependencies.</li> </ul>
        
        Bug Fixes:
        <p> After finishing the restructure, I revisited the obstacle spawn bug. Turns out I wasn’t 
        reinitializing the obstacle array correctly. Fixing that solved both the instant-spawn issue 
        and another bug where obstacles sometimes stopped moving after reset. </p> <p> By the end of 
        this version, the game looked and played the same to users—but under the hood, it was far 
        cleaner and easier to maintain. These changes will make future development much smoother. </p>`,
