                description: `<p>The start of this project was delayed. I knew what I needed to do, but I was 
                preoccupied with creating other projects first. After making the changes from the previous version, 
                I showed them to my teammate, they approved and found the codebase much easier to work with. This 
                meant future iterations would be less complicated, and finding bugs would become a lot simpler too.</p>

                <h2>Further Details:</h2>

                <p><strong>First step:</strong><br>
                I started by removing the controls from the main codebase and creating a new folder specifically 
                for them. I split the controls into two movement classes and one input class. This setup meant that 
                if we ever added new inputs, they would only need to go into one place, and changing how movement 
                worked later would cause minimal issues.</p>

                <p><strong>Second step:</strong><br>
                I removed obstacle spawning and movement from the main code and placed them into their own folder, 
                splitting them into two separate classes. This did cause a bug: after resetting the game, obstacles 
                would immediately spawn instead of waiting the proper amount of time. At the time, I decided to 
                place this bug on a lower priority and focus first on finishing the code separation.</p>

                <p><strong>Third step:</strong><br>
                Finally, I removed the game manager from the main system and split it into three classes: 
                <code>Score</code>, <code>Time</code>, and <code>GameOver</code>.<br>
                - I tackled the <code>Score</code> class first, but quickly realized I had to refactor 
                <code>Time</code> too, because many parts of the scoring system were dependent on it.<br>
                - Once <code>Time</code> was properly separated, both <code>Score</code> and <code>Time</code> functioned correctly.<br>
                - After that, I moved on to restructuring the game restart and game over logic.</p>

                <p>With all these parts working, the codebase became way easier to work with, and I noticeably 
                reduced the reading complexity.</p>

                <h2>Bug Revisit:</h2>

                <p>After the core restructure, I returned to the earlier obstacle spawning bug. 
                The issue was that I hadn't properly reinitialized the obstacle array after a reset. I wasn’t removing the old obstacles. 
                Because of that, the game was basically placing you back into a world 
                where all the obstacles had simply moved positions.</p>

                <p>Fixing this not only solved the instant-spawn issue but also cleared up a second bug where 
                obstacles would sometimes stop moving entirely after a reset.</p>

                <p>By the end of this version, the game <em>looked and played</em> the same for users, but under 
                the hood, it was way cleaner, more maintainable, and better prepared for future updates. 
                Even though players wouldn’t notice the changes, for development and bug-fixing, it made a huge 
                difference.</p>

                how multiplayer works, it's been a slow but steady process of improving both my skills and my 
                code.</p>

                <p>This update was originally meant to introduce multiplayer. I managed to get two players on the 
                field, but noticed that one wasn’t interacting properly, and the other was moving faster. 
                After looking through the code again, I found the problem.</p>

                <p>I hadn’t implemented delta time. So I started refactoring again. It took longer than I expected, 
                for a few different reasons. But between fixing that and continuing my research on multiplayer, 
                I realized what my next step needs to be: a proper menu and lobby system.</p>

                <p>I’ve also figured out what the *end goal* for this project is for me—and that’s given me real 
                motivation to get back into it with full focus.</p>

                though none of the current scenes use one yet.</p>

                <p>Thankfully, I only had to refactor one class thanks to how clean the earlier code had become. 
                That saved a lot of time.</p>

                <p>Also added a super helpful tool that lets me export the game as a <code>.exe</code> file, so

                description: `<p>After having to take a short holiday, I got to work with multiplayer. 
                This was going to start by having me work on the most basic part of multiplayer — the 
                lobby scene. As I began working on it, I realized how the socket system works 
                *almost exactly* like signals in <code>GODOT</code>. I’ve got some experience with signals 
                and could very easily get the system working from there.</p>

                <p>Even with the logic now clicked into place, it took a bit to learn the syntax between 
                when to use <code>io.emit</code>, <code>socket.emit</code>, or 
                <code>socket.broadcast.emit</code>. These are things I’m still learning, but with time and 
                effort it’ll come. I’ve been finding that some trial and error helps a lot in this regard.</p>

                <p>Some major challenges I had were refactoring <code>GameManager</code>, and moving 
                <code>main.js</code>, <code>index.html</code>, and <code>style.css</code> to the 
                <code>/public</code> folder. I also learned how to make the version/patch number that 
                each of these notes use actually reflect on GitHub itself. That’s been huge for me — I 
                now have real versioning on GitHub outside of just looking at commits.</p>
