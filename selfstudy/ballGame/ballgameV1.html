        description: `<p> This version started a bit later than planned, as I was occupied with other projects. But once I returned to it, I focused on restructuring the codebase to make future development easier. After showing the changes to my teammate, they found the new structure much easier to work with—which made debugging and iterating smoother. </p>
Key Changes:
<ul> <li><strong>Input Refactor:</strong> Moved control logic into a separate folder with two movement classes and one input class. This modular setup means future inputs can be added in one place with minimal disruption.</li> <li><strong>Obstacle Logic:</strong> Extracted obstacle spawning and movement into their own folder and split into two classes. Initially caused a bug where obstacles spawned too quickly after reset—this was noted for later.</li> <li><strong>Game Manager Breakdown:</strong> Separated game management into three classes: <code>Score</code>, <code>Time</code>, and <code>GameOver</code>. Time had to be decoupled before score would function properly, due to dependencies.</li> </ul>
Bug Fixes:
<p> After finishing the restructure, I revisited the obstacle spawn bug. Turns out I wasn’t reinitializing the obstacle array correctly. Fixing that solved both the instant-spawn issue and another bug where obstacles sometimes stopped moving after reset. </p> <p> By the end of this version, the game looked and played the same to users—but under the hood, it was far cleaner and easier to maintain. These changes will make future development much smoother. </p>`,
