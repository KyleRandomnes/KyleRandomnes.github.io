- Fun fact: Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible.....
  I'd argue it wasn't edible when first made but for those who like honey, you don't need to check the expiry  date anymore.

### About This Portfolio

This Portfolio is my personal profile of things I've made and done, all my projects and some history and planning for each will be placed here.
I also intend on keeping it up to date.
