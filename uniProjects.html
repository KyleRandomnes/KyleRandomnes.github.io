                I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at AUT, with an expected graduation in December 2024. 
                Below are a few selected projects that Iâ€™ve completed, which I am particularly proud of.

                This was my first assignment for game dev, I had to learn c++ and how to use 
                a simple framework of a game engine. I took inspiration from using Finite 
                State Machines in another class at the time to try make a puzzle solving 
                game using the same ideas. This taught me a lot about both classes at once.
                This project was one of the hardest for me to program so far at least.

                This was my first time using Freeglut libraries. I learnt how to make a 
                2D scene and was tasked with creating 2 unique features. I decided to make 
                3, the sun and moon moving around the sky along with the day night cycle. I 
                also animated the grass along the bottom where it will "blow" in the wind 
                Then finally when a user presses t, the snowman will talk.

                This was my first Unity project, developed in collaboration with a team of four, 
                including myself and three friends. We worked on this project while learning about 
                SCRUM and sprint management. My primary contributions were implementing the camera 
                and character movement, as well as serving as the project owner.
