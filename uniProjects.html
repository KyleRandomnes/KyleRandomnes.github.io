                I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at AUT, with an expected graduation in December 2024. 
                Below are a few selected projects that I’ve completed, which I am particularly proud of.

                This was my second Game Dev assignment unlike the first this one was a group project 
                where 4 members would either create a new game or work on an existing one. We decided 
                as a group to work on an existing game, Ternion. This was a 2D side scroller RPG. We 
                were worked with animated sprites, box2D and sound mixer to try create the best version 
                of the game that we could in our time limit. Overall we managed to achieve our desired 
                goals and delivered the product on time.

                This was my first assignment in game development, where I had to learn C++ and work with 
                a simple game engine framework. I drew inspiration from a class on Finite State Machines 
                (FSMs) and applied those concepts to create a puzzle-solving game. This project was a 
                significant learning experience, bridging concepts from both subjects. It has been one of 
                the most challenging projects I’ve programmed so far.

                This was my first experience using FreeGLUT libraries, where I learned to 
                create a 2D scene. I was tasked with developing two unique features but decided to 
                implement three. I added a dynamic sun and moon that move across the sky, simulating a 
                day-night cycle, as well as animated grass at the bottom that "blows" in the wind. Lastly, 
                pressing the 'T' key triggers the snowman to talk.

                This was my first Unity project, developed in collaboration with a team of four, 
                including myself and three friends. We worked on this project while learning about 
                SCRUM and sprint management. My primary contributions were implementing the camera 
                and character movement, as well as serving as the project owner.
