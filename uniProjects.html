                I am currently studying BSc Computer Science at AUT, I am expected to finish
                in 2024 and the end of the second semester. The projects below are some of the
                few I completed and am quite pleased with.

                This was the first Unity project I made with a team of 4, it was me
                and 3 friends. We created this project while learning about SCRUM and
                how to handle sprints. I did most of the work on getting the camera
                and character movement, while also being project owner.
