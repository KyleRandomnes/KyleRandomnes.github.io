                I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at AUT, with an expected graduation in December 2024. 
                Below are a few selected projects that I’m particularly proud of.

                This was my second Game Development assignment. Unlike the first, this was a group project, 
                where 4 members either created a new game or worked on an existing one. As a group, we decided to 
                work on an existing game, Ternion, a 2D side-scroller RPG. We worked with animated sprites, Box2D, 
                and a sound mixer to create the best version of the game we could within the time limit. Overall, 
                we successfully met our goals and delivered the product on time.

            <p>
                This was my first assignment in game development, where I learnt C++ and 
                worked with a simple game engine framework. I drew inspiration from a class 
                on Finite State Machines (FSMs) and applied those concepts to create a 
                puzzle-solving game. This project was a significant learning experience, bridging concepts 
                from both subjects. It has been one of the most challenging projects I’ve programmed so far.

                This was my second experience using FreeGLUT libraries, where I learnt to create a 3D 
                scene. I was tasked with creating a helicopter that could fly around the scene. I decided 
                to make mine a drone instead, which required creative problem-solving to manage function 
                calls within a loop and adjust the drawing point of objects. Once the drone was built, I 
                focused on building additional objects around the scene and ended up adding some wind 
                turbines.

                This was my first experience using FreeGLUT libraries, where I learned to create a 2D 
                scene. I was tasked with developing two unique features but decided to implement three. 
                I added a dynamic sun and moon that move across the sky, simulating a day-night cycle, 
                as well as animated grass that "blows" in the wind at the bottom. Finally, pressing the 'T' 
                key triggers the snowman to talk.

                This was my first Unity project, developed in collaboration with a team of four, 
                including myself and three friends. We worked on this project while learning about 
                SCRUM and sprint management. My primary contributions were implementing the camera 
                and character movement, as well as serving as the project owner.
