            documentation, which involved a significant learning curve. Throughout 
            the process, our understanding of Git improved considerably. The 
            primary objective of this course was to gain hands-on experience with 
            Agile methodologies and sprint-based development.</p>

            <p>To achieve this, we formed a team of four and assigned leadership 
            roles. I was selected as the Project Owner, my teammate Brooklyn took 
            on the role of Scrum Master, and the remaining two team members served 
            as developers.</p>`,

        subtitle: 'Trello',
        description: `<p>The project began with the first sprint, which lasted four 
            weeks. We started by forming teams and setting up a Trello board, where 
            we assigned and rated tasks based on their perceived difficulty. Each 
            team member was required to take on a minimum of two tasks for the 
            first sprint.</p>

            <p>This initial sprint presented several challenges, ultimately leading 
            to a full reset midway through due to misconfigured Git settings. 
            Initially, only one team member could push changes to the repository, 
            which significantly hindered progress. Once this issue was resolved, 
            we were able to move forward. However, based on our team\’s definition 
            of "done," we had only completed three tasks by the end of the sprint. 
            This experience provided valuable insight into how we could better 
            manage our sprints moving forward.</p>

            <p>The three completed tasks included a day-night cycle, implemented 
            by Brooklyn, terrain generation by Echo, and sound integration, also 
            completed by Echo.</p>`,

        Title: `Tasks ~ Sprint 2`,
        subtitle: 'Features',
        description: `<p>After Sprint 1, our team had a clear understanding of the 
            work ahead of us. We had discussed and adjusted our definition of 
            "done" to improve our efficiency in this next phase. We quickly 
            assigned two tasks to each member, with my brother, Rauen, previously 
            assigned to work on controls, which I then took over.</p>

            <p>The initial task assignments were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brooklyn: Build an inventory system and a 
                    shopping/selling system.</li>
                <li>Echo: Implement working NPCs and create item art.</li>
                <li>Kyle: Implement scene transitions and get the player 
                    character functioning.</li>
                <li>Rauen: Implement fishing mechanics and ensure caught fish 
                    are added to the inventory.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I immediately began working on the player character functionality 
            so that my team members could continue making progress on their 
            tasks. I also updated our system to support a more modern controller 
            version. Next, I focused on enabling scene transitions, which allowed 
            me to complete my two assigned tasks.</p>
            
            <p>With some free time available, I took the initiative to add 
            additional tasks for myself. These included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a house</li>
                <li>Add a pause menu</li>
                <li>Create a menu screen</li>
                <li>Implement a lighting system</li>
                <li>Build a dock for the fishing mechanic</li>
                <li>Add a settings button</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I only added these tasks to my list after completing them, 
            ensuring each was fully implemented.</p>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, Brooklyn, Rauen, and Echo made significant progress on 
            their tasks. Rauen also worked on implementing health points (HP), a 
            hotbar, and a leveling system. By the end of the sprint, our game felt 
            much more complete and functional, especially when compared to the 
            challenges of Sprint 1.</p>            `,
