            Initially, Rauen was tasked with developing the collision system, and he successfully 
            implemented a basic framework that allowed objects to detect collisions. However, 
            we were subsequently informed that Box2D, a physics engine, was required for the project. 
            As a result, we had to transition from our custom collision system to Box2D, which 
            necessitated a significant adjustment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrating Box2D into the project proved to be challenging and time-consuming. 
            Despite the initial setbacks, we were able to get Box2D functioning by the final week 
            of the project. Once the system was operational, the remaining components of the game, 
            such as the mobs and the boss fight, were completed quickly. The collision system was 
            fundamental to the functionality of the game, and with it in place, we were able to focus 
            on refining other features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I implemented sound effects that were triggered by collision events, 
            further enhancing the game's user experience. While the switch to Box2D required 
            considerable effort and impacted the timeline, it ultimately contributed to the 
            successful completion of the project, ensuring that the core gameplay mechanics were robust 
            and functional.

            Karl was responsible for the game's graphics, particularly focusing on the animations. Prior 
            to the project becoming a team effort, he had already begun working on the animations for the 
            game. He contributed significantly by creating and implementing various character animations, 
            including those for mobs, attacks, and backgrounds. Karl also played a key role in stitching 
            together the assets and determining how they would function within the game. Given that the 
            game was originally his concept, it was a natural fit for him to lead the graphical aspect, 
            allowing his artistic vision to be fully realized through the characters and their actions.

            This project was rather rushed in a lot of ways, we had 4 weeks to do the entire project. 
            It took a lot of work to get working, with a lot of changing requirements. A good example of 
            this is that we created a full collision system of our own, then were told that sadly the 
            mark scheme required the use of Box2D so the entire weeks work was wasted, on a 4 week project. 
            This meant we landed up not keeping documentation rather just, a lot of scrambling and throwing 
            what could work into the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            This resulted in a project that still worked, but definitely needs a lot of polish on it. It also
            means not a lot of documentation. The project overall, still entertaining, but very stressful. I
            think this is a project I'm likely to look back at and rework but on an actual game engine this
            way I can get a lot more done without as much stress, perhaps with some of the same team mates.

        overview: `Ternion was my final major project from university, developed in
         collaboration with three other students: Karl, Rauen, and Ethan. 
         The project began with a group vote to decide on which of our games would be 
         developed further, and Ternion was selected as the winning project. 
         Although we had ambitious plans for a wide range of features, time 
         constraints led us to focus on refining the core gameplay instead.\n
         The game was coded in C++ using a custom framework, along with middleware 
         tools like SDL, Box2D, GLEW, and ImGUI. We used Visual Studio as our IDE 
         and sourced sprites from creators such as Chierit, MonoPixelArt, 
         Recursion Corp, Pedrodis, Foozle, and Craftpix.com. Music was provided by 
         BlakeJ and Josh Woodward, with sound effects from SoundBible.
