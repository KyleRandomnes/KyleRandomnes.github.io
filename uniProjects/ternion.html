<h1>Ternion</h1>

            Ternion was my final major project from university, developed in collaboration 
            with three other students: Karl, Rauen, and Ethan. The project began with a group 
            vote to decide on which of our games would be developed further, and Ternion was selected 
            as the winning project. Although we had ambitious plans for a wide range of features, 
            time constraints led us to focus on refining the core gameplay instead.

        <p>
            The game was coded in C++ using a custom framework, along with middleware 
            tools like SDL, Box2D, GLEW, and ImGUI. We used Visual Studio as our IDE 
            and sourced sprites from creators such as Chierit, MonoPixelArt, Recursion Corp, 
            Pedrodis, Foozle, and Craftpix.com. Music was provided by BlakeJ and Josh Woodward, 
            with sound effects from SoundBible.

            This project was rather rushed in a lot of ways, we had 4 weeks to do the entire project. 
            It took a lot of work to get working, with a lot of changing requirements. A good example of 
            this is that we created a full collision system of our own, then were told that sadly the 
            mark scheme required the use of Box2D so the entire weeks work was wasted, on a 4 week project. 
            This meant we landed up not keeping documentation rather just, a lot of scrambling and throwing 
            what could work into the project.

            This resulted in a project that still worked, but definetly needs a lot of polish on it. It also 
            means not a lot of documentation. The project overall, still entertaining, but very stressful. I 
            think this is a project I'm lightly to look back at and rework but on an actual game engine this 
            way I can get a lot more done without as much stress, perhaps with some of the same team mates.
