            Ternion was my final major project from university, developed in collaboration 
            with three other students: Karl, Rauen, and Ethan. The project began with a group 
            vote to decide on which of our games would be developed further, and Ternion was selected 
            as the winning project. Although we had ambitious plans for a wide range of features, 
            time constraints led us to focus on refining the core gameplay instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game was coded in C++ using a custom framework, along with middleware 
            tools like SDL, Box2D, GLEW, and ImGUI. We used Visual Studio as our IDE 
            and sourced sprites from creators such as Chierit, MonoPixelArt, Recursion Corp, 
            Pedrodis, Foozle, and Craftpix.com. Music was provided by BlakeJ and Josh Woodward, 
            with sound effects from SoundBible.
