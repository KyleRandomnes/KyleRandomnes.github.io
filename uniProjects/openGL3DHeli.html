        description: `<p>This project was completed for my Computer Graphics 
            Programming course. It began with a basic OpenGL framework and 
            required us to create a helicopter. However, I requested permission 
            to design a drone instead, and once approved, the project became 
            particularly exciting.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, due to the demands of my Game Development project, 
            I was unable to dedicate as much time and attention to this program as 
            I would have liked. Despite this, it provided valuable experience in 
            working with OpenGL and real-time rendering techniques.</p>`,

        description: `<p>I had been watching drone videos around the time this 
        project was assigned, which inspired me to create a drone instead 
        of a helicopter. This decision allowed me to experiment with a greater 
        variety of components compared to my peers, ultimately leading to a 
        successful outcome.</p>

        <p>Designing the drone required developing creative patterns to make the 
        wings function properly while ensuring the code remained as memory-efficient 
        as possible. Additionally, I had to solve challenges related to rendering 
        the ground and implementing the skybox. Once these elements were in place, 
        the project came together seamlessly.</p>`,

        as it felt less pressured compared to my other coursework. Had I taken 
        this subject earlier, I likely would have dedicated more time to exploring 
        unique and creative ideas. Despite its smaller scope, I was able to 
        achieve an A overall for the project.</p>

        <p>While I enjoyed working on it, I don\’t anticipate revisiting this 
        project in the future. It provided a refreshing break from more demanding 
        subjects, but ultimately, it wasn\’t as complex as I typically prefer my 
        projects to be.</p>`,
