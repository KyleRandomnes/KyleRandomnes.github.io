        description: `This was the first assignment in my Computer Graphics course. 
        The task was to create a 2D snowman with falling snow, along with two 
        additional features. However, I ultimately implemented three, as I was not 
        satisfied with how one of them turned out.`,

        title: 'Tasks',
        subtitle: 'Features',
        description: `<p>After completing the main tasks, I focused on adding extra 
            features, starting with the snow interaction. I implemented snow that 
            would fall and hit the ground, then gradually melt upon contact. 
            Additionally, I added randomly placed grass along the floor and created 
            an animation effect to simulate wind blowing through it. To achieve 
            this, I first sorted the array of grass based on its location and then 
            applied the animation effect.</p>

            <p>The next feature I worked on was a day-night cycle, which required 
            the sun to move across the sky. Following that, I added a moon that 
            would also traverse the sky. When the paths of the moon and sun 
            intersected, the moon would "eclipse" the sun, creating a special visual 
            effect.</p>

            <p>The final feature I implemented was the snowman\’s ability to talk. 
            When the user pressed the 't' key, the snowman would display a series 
            of text messages, starting with a greeting. This added a layer of 
            interactivity and made the snowman feel more alive.</p>`,

        description: `This project required us to maintain a logbook to track our 
        tasks and daily progress. As a result, I kept detailed notes on each task 
        I completed throughout the project.`,

        description: `<p>This project was a good introduction to glut, it felt 
            easy to use and also allowed me to try other ideas out, which was 
            good relief from other subjects.</p>
            
            <p>The sad part for this project was not being able to get the grass 
            to generate along the floor as I wanted to because for some reason 
            the computer did averages differently and resulted in steeper 
            curves for the grass than it did for the ground. This meant the 
            grass was stuck at the bottom, along with the snow</p>`,
