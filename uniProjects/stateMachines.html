        title: 'State Machines',
        description: `<p>This project was my first major assignment in my Game 
                Development class, focusing on learning a game framework and following 
                a structured development cycle. Developed solo, the project presented 
                several challenges, particularly in adapting to the framework\’s 
                limitations and requirements.<\p>
                
                <p>At the time, I was also studying finite state machines in another 
                course and found the problem-solving aspect particularly engaging. 
                Inspired by this, I designed a 2D game, dedicating significant time 
                to pre-production—sketching levels, refining mechanics, and 
                ensuring a clear development roadmap before programming began.<\p>
                
                <p>Once implementation started, the most significant challenge 
                emerged: managing the extensive number of button inputs required for 
                gameplay. Despite these technical hurdles, the project was 
                successfully completed, earning an A-.<\p>
                
                <p>I see strong potential for this game as a mobile title and plan 
                to further develop it in a dedicated game engine. While the final 
                version within the class constraints is not as polished as I would 
                like, the four-week development cycle provided valuable experience 
                in both game design and technical problem-solving.<\p>`,

        description: `<p>For this game, I dedicated significant time to planning its 
            mechanics and structure in advance. This pre-production phase allowed me 
            to define how each component of the game should function, ensuring 
            clarity in both design and implementation. As seen in the project 
            documentation, I created flowcharts and game flow diagrams, alongside 
            concept art, to visually represent these ideas.<\p>

            <p>This thorough planning greatly facilitated the programming process, 
            as it provided a clear roadmap and allowed me to identify the 
            necessary middleware tools early on. One of the key requirements 
            was finding tools to assist in solving the finite state machine. 
            However, I discovered towards the end of the project that C++ lacked 
            the specific toolset I needed for this purpose.<\p>`,

        description: `<p>The graphics for this game involved researching various 
            design approaches used in puzzle and logic games. I explored how 
            Finite State Machines are typically represented mathematically and 
            concluded that a green and red color scheme would be the most intuitive 
            for conveying the system\’s states.<\p>

            <p>Building upon this concept, I dedicated significant time to 
            designing buttons that would function as both accept and reject states. 
            I applied this simple yet effective design consistently across all 
            buttons, ensuring a clean and cohesive user interface.<\p>`,
